# Targa type 10 C - CUDA
TGA (Data type 10: Run Length Encoded, RGB images) rough implementation in C - CUDA.

TGA or TARGA format is a format for describing bitmap images.
It is capable of representing bitmaps ranging from black and white, indexed colour, and RGB colour. The format also supports various compression methods.

|        |        |  This field is a one-byte unsigned integer, specifying     |
|        |        |  the length of the Image Identification Field.  Its range  |
|        |        |  is 0 to 255.  A value of 0 means that no Image            |
|        |        |  Identification Field is included.                         |

|        |        |  Contains a free-form identification field of the length   |
|        |        |  specified in byte 1 of the image record.  It's usually    |
|        |        |  omitted ( length in byte 1 = 0 ), but can be up to 255    |
|        |        |  characters.  If more identification information is        |
|        |        |  required, it can be stored after the image data.          |

|        |        |  packets.  There are two types of packets:  Run-length     |
|        |        |  encoded packets, and raw packets.  Both have a 1-byte     |
|        |        |  header, identifying the type of packet and specifying a   |
|        |        |  count, followed by a variable-length body.                |

|        |        |  For the run length packet, the header is followed by      |
|        |        |  a single color value, which is assumed to be repeated     |
|        |        |  the number of times specified in the header.  The         |
|        |        |  packet may cross scan lines ( begin on one line and end   |
|        |        |  on the next ).                                            |

|        |        |  the number of color values specified in the header.       |
|        |        |  The color entries themselves are two bytes, three bytes,  |
|        |        |  or four bytes ( for Targa 16, 24, and 32 ), and are       |
|        |        |  broken down as follows:                                   |
|        |        |  The 3 byte entry contains 1 byte each of blue, green,     |
|        |        |  and red.                                                  |
|        |        |  The 4 byte entry contains 1 byte each of blue, green,     |
|        |        |  red, and attribute.  For faster speed (because of the     |
|        |        |  hardware of the Targa board itself), Targa 24 image are   |
|        |        |  sometimes stored as Targa 32 images.                      |
